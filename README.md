This project was used to show the utilization of an express server side note taking application. Using the fs node package, we dynamically update and read from a json file to make notes that show up on the page and we are capable of adding and deleting more.

It doesn't need to be installed, but you may clone the repo and run it locally if you want to. Otherwise, it is hosted on Heroku at this [link](https://stark-river-85799-622dd2aab1b9.herokuapp.com).

It is really just a showcase. You may inspect it to see Express being used in action, otherwise it just kind of exists.
